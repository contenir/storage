/**
 * A single item returned by StorageInterface::list() or ::store().
 *
 * $id is a stable identifier the JS layer round-trips on delete/rename
 * operations. Local backends compute it as md5(name) to preserve the existing
 * FileBrowser contract; cloud backends derive it from the object key.
 *
 * $path is relative to the storage root (e.g. "products/hero.jpg"), never
 * absolute. The mapping to a public URL is the backend's responsibility — see
 * StorageInterface::url().
 *
 * For directories, $mime is "inode/directory" so isImage() correctly returns
 * false without a separate type check.
 *
 * $image carries the dimensions detected at store() time for raster images;
 * it is null for directories, non-images, and entries produced by list() (which
 * does not sniff dimensions). Callers persist it as provenance metadata.
